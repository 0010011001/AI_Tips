## Prepare

### Import Assets

If you setup your own modding project in unity editor then you need to import assets to get started. 

You can get nice small prepared assets here.

### Prepare Scene

Now you need to prepare your scene

## Repeat

### Test Hairs

Place hair object and adjust the scale scale it with 3d import options 

Set hair layer to 10 (A)

Setup CmpHair.cs

Setup DynamicBones (you can buy it or do something bad but I purchased one before.)

### Test Textures

set texture has actual transparency in alpha.

### Build Assetbundles

you need to build two assetbundles

- hair asset bundle
- hair "texture" asset bundle

### Change shaders

We don't have hair shader replica atm, so we need to replace the shader to make it work nicely in game. I have example material .unity3d file in here (Click?)

### Add to List

You can add your hair to list by using this template.

### Pack up 

Pack it into sideloader mod!
